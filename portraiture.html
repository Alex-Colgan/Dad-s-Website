      This self portrait was painted in couple of afternoons with a lamp to my right and natural light to my left.<br>
      <br>The combination of the two light sources provided some interesting contrasts across the face. <br>
      <br> It was painted, like the majority of my work, with acrylics on the smooth side of a sheet of hardboard prepared with several coats of white acrylic undercoat.<br><br>
      My children have been somewhat critical of the result, commenting that I have made myself appear too 'grumpy' quite unlike my normal cheerful demeanour!<br>
