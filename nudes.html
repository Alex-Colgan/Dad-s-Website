      This painting was completed in about one and a half hours. I had been attending an all day session, painting from the nude, run by fellow artist Sara Parsons. <br>
      <br>Having worked for most of the day on an unsatisfactory piece I was left with only 90 minutes before the end of the pose and the session.<br>
      <br> I had only a large piece of board left on which to work and no drawing materials. Nonetheless I decided to attempt to complete a painting in the time left and set rapidly to work. <br>
      <br> The resultant painting is so lively and full of energy that it has become one of my favourites.<br><br>
