			I was taught at Ealing School of Art where I was influenced by an evening class tutor in Life Drawing and Portraiture by the name of Frank Auerbach - now celebrated as an internationally renowned artist. <br>
			<br>It was he who taught me how to see the reality of my subject rather than what I thought I was looking at. <br>
			<br>Flights of fancy or abstraction have never been of interest to me. I like to paint and draw portraits, the nude figure, still life - including flowers - and if the weather is good, the occasional landscape.<br>
			<br> I work in acrylics preferring it to oils for its quick drying properties.
