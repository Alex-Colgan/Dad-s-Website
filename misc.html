      This is an example of work that didn't fit into any of the categories above.<br>
      <br>This study of a display of lilies was painted on a canvas given to me.<br>
      <br>It had previously been painted as a very loose abstract with a small amount of texture in the paint.<br>
      <br>This I scraped off and initially, had intended to cover the surface during the painting of the lilies. <br>
      <br>However, as I worked I realised that the green echoed the colour of the leaves seen through the glass of the vase and the brown provided a little warmth into what otherwise might have been too cool a painting.<br>
      <br> I hope you will agree with me that I made the right decision.<br><br>
