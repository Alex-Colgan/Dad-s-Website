       This arrangement of objects was set up for me by one of my students who wanted to see my approach to painting a still life subject. <br>
       <br>I'm not sure if she realised how 'busy' a grouping she was presenting. It was certainly the most complicated I had attempted but nothing daunted, I decided to have a go. <br>
       <br> On completion I was quite pleased with the result and my student was suitably impressed. <br>
       <br>Subsequently it was also admired by the art editor of Artist and Illustrators magazine. <br>
       <br>She used a reproduction of it as an example of my work in a autobiographical article I had been asked to write for the magazine.
